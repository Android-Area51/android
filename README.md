FIRST OF ALL: If you use this repo, please credit the Android Area 51 Development team http://androidarea51.com

This set of repositories is used to build the generic AreaROM system. It is based on Google Source (AOSP) for 2.3.7.
As most AOSP based ROMs are, this is a work in progress and will need to be adjusted for each device. Device files
are not included in this source due to it's infancy. As more support is added, so with the number of official devices.
